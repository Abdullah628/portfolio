- **Title:** Identification of Chromosomes In Bioinformatics Using Deep Learning Algorithms.
- **Problem Statement:** Our research automates human chromosome karyotyping classification through deep learning, replacing manual, time-consuming methods. By leveraging deep learning, we enhance accuracy and streamline diagnosis, employing preprocessing and data augmentation for image preparation. Our goal is to develop a robust model for accurate chromosome identification and genetic disorder detection, potentially transforming karyotype analysis. Challenges include ensuring model reliability and clinical integration, aiming to enhance chromosome analysis effectiveness in bioinformatics.

- **Motivation of the Work:** Our motivation stems from a personal connection to the medical field, fueled by the loss of our father to cancer(two of us). Moreover with a childhood interest in medicine and a passion for technology, we're driven to leverage advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms to improve disease detection, particularly in the early stages. By focusing on the identification of chorosomes, which are pivotal in diseases like cancer, we aim to develop innovative diagnostic tools that can revolutionize healthcare by enabling earlier interventions and improving patient outcomes.
